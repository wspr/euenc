THE EU ENCODING(S) v0.2

Warning: don't install this package with Latin Modern fonts prior to
version 1.106, which was released in Feb 2008.

This package is the first release of the first step towards offering a
LaTeX font encoding based on unicode.  No macro support is offered (the
encoding is just a placeholder for now) but an EU1 Latin Modern encoding is
offered in order to access the OpenType versions of those fonts.

N.B. This will only work when xdvipdfmx is used as the output driver for
XeTeX; xdv2pdf (Mac OS X only) does not support OpenType fonts that aren't
installed in the system itself. As of XeTeX v0.997, xdv2pdf is no longer
the default driver in Mac OS X.

Usually you'll just want to use fontspec:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}

Example of use without fontspec:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[EU1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}

See the accompanying file <test-euxlm.ltx> for a complete example.

____________
INSTALLATION

CTAN contains the necessary files to install for this package:
  - eu1enc.def
  - lm/eu*.fd (* is a wild card: twelve files in all)
These should be placed in $TEXMF/tex/xelatex/euenc .

To generate these files from the euenc.dtx file, run
`pdflatex --shell-scape eu1enc.dtx`. This will extract the eu1enc.def
file and generate lm/eu*.fd files by executing `sh convert-lmfd.sh`.
