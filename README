THE EU ENCODING(S) v0.2

Warning: don't install this package with Latin Modern fonts prior to
version 1.106, which was released in Feb 2008.

This package is the first release of the first step towards offering a
LaTeX font encoding based on unicode.  No macro support is offered (the
encoding is just a placeholder for now) but the EU1 (for XeTeX) and EU2
(for LuaTeX) Latin Modern encoding is offered in order to access the
OpenType versions of those fonts.

N.B. For XeTeX, this will only work when xdvipdfmx is used as the output
driver; xdv2pdf (Mac OS X only) does not support OpenType fonts that aren't
installed in the system itself. As of XeTeX v0.997, xdv2pdf is no longer
the default driver in Mac OS X.

Usually you'll just want to use fontspec:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}

See the accompanying file <test-euxlm.ltx> for a complete example.

INSTALLATION

CTAN contains the necessary files to install for this package:
  - eu1enc.def
  - eu2enc.def
  - lm/eu*.fd (* is a wild card: twelve files in all)
These should be placed in $TEXMF/tex/latex/euenc .
