                          The EU encodings

                          
This package is the first release of the first step towards offering a
LaTeX font encoding based on unicode.  No macro support is offered (the
encoding is just a placeholder for now) but the EU1 (for XeTeX) and EU2
(for LuaTeX) Latin Modern encoding is offered in order to access the
OpenType versions of those fonts.

This package is developed on <http://github.com/wspr/euenc>.


Installation
------------

Here are the recommended installation methods (preferred first).

1. If you are using TeX Live 2008 or later, use 'tlmgr install euenc'.
Alternatively, try your (TeX or Linux) distribution's package management system.

2. a. Grab euenc.tds.zip on the CTAN.
   b. Unzip it at the root of one or your TDS trees.
   c. You may need to update some filename database after, see your TeX
distribution's manual for details.

3. a. Grab the sources from CTAN or github.
   b. Run 'make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf'.
   c. See 2c.

4. Try to figure it out by looking at the Makefile and comments in the sources.
Note that the generation of the files need a shell and doesn't work under
cygwin.
