_______________________
THE EUx ENCODINGS v0.1h

This package is a step towards offering a LaTeX font encoding
based on unicode. An example file "test-euxlm.ltx" is distributed
with the package.

This package is mainly used underneath the fontspec package;
unless you wish to manually perform font installation and loading,
you will generally not need to use euenc directly.

The euenc package provides the EU1 encoding for unicode fonts
in XeTeX, and the EU2 encoding for unicode fonts in LuaTeX.

No macro support is offered under XeTeX, for which Ross Moore's
xunicode package should be used to provide LaTeX support for
access to unicode symbols and accents.

For LuaTeX, we have taken a subset of xunicode and incorporated
it into the EU2 encoding, so no extra packages need to be loaded.

Please see the documentation euenc.pdf for further information.

This package is developed at <http://github.com/wspr/euenc>.


Installation
------------

Here are the recommended installation methods (preferred first).

1. If you are using TeX Live 2008 or later, use 'tlmgr install euenc'.
Alternatively, try your (TeX or Linux) distribution's package management system.

2. a. Download euenc.tds.zip from CTAN.
   b. Unzip it at the root of one or your TDS trees.
   c. You may need to update some filename database after, see your TeX
distribution's manual for details.

3. a. Grab the sources from CTAN or github.
   b. Run 'make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf'.
   c. See 2c.

4. Try to figure it out by looking at the Makefile and comments in the sources.
Note that the generation of the files need a shell and doesn't work under
cygwin.
